# HW_CommentNoiseGrid_Leo

My project does a lot of ofxGui. This project looks like a square, and it is composed lots of small "grass".
There are five gui insid. When people change the Frequance progress bar, the directly of each grass will change.
When people change the time Time Frequence, the speed of the changing direction grass will increase or decress.
Magnitude progress bar will change the distance of each grass.
Grid Size progress bar will control size of the whole picture.
Grid Resolution prograss bar will control the density of grasses.
